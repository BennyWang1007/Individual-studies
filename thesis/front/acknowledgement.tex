I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Professor Shang-Liang Chen, for his invaluable guidance and insightful advice throughout this research. I also thank my classmates for their thoughtful discussions and feedback, the senior lab members for their assistance in setting up the experimental environment, and an anonymous friend for providing high-end GPUs, which allowed me to perform tests and training without waiting in turn. Finally, I am deeply grateful to my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout the course of my research.
