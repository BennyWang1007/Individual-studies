\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
In todayâ€™s fast-paced society, the public often lacks the time to thoroughly read complete news articles. Sensational headlines may bias information judgment. A compact Chinese summarization model capable of running on mobile devices could efficiently provide concise and meaningful summaries, improving both the speed and quality of information acquisition.

\section{Objectives}

The goal of this research is to combine knowledge distillation and curriculum training strategies to compress model parameters while enhancing generalization and language comprehension. The ultimate aim is to deploy a high-quality Chinese news summarization system on mobile devices, achieving a small-model, high-quality solution.
